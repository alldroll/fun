In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order,
what is the probability that you hire exactly one time? What is the probability
you hire exactly n times?

Solution:

* 1 2 3 ... n - order, so there is 1/n probability that first assistant is the
best

* 1/n * 1 / (n - 1) * 1 / (n - 2) ... = 1/n!
